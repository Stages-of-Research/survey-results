At all levels of my career there were obstacles for me as a women in science. When I was studying there was still the prejudice about a women studying in computer science, that they might not be capable, that a computer scientist cannot be pretty and clever, ... In my studies it was clearly mentioned by male students that they would never accept a women as a boss (1989). This might have changed but is was the mindset of that time. In all levels of my career I was the only women. When I had success it was then sometimes mentioned that it was because I was a women. Womens' topics and talking about equality was for decades something that women - such as me - were fighting for - it took until around 2020 when more men were stepping in and understanding equality as a responsibility for all genders. I have lost 20% of my intellectual potential and time because I was a women, because I had to show more to get the same positions, because I had to spend time in committee meetings when others made their careers, because I was not in the right boys networks, ...

","For too many years I felt it was alway me mentioning to respect and be aware of inequality. For a decade I mentioned it in so many meeting, that it is not only Mitarbeiter but also Mitarbeiterin, that it is not man month but person months and so on.  Women were responsible for gender quality. Women who were acting to make change got a negative image as ""Emanze"" (feminist). The universities took and my institute took a long time to finally implement better rules for gender quality. Only in 2021 we see some gender equality plan  now on the university level, on the level of European Projects and so on. But is was a very long and low process.

People would not listen to what women said was needed.

In Germany I was not given a desk, let alone an office, when I became professor. I ended up having to buy my own computer, as I was only allowed to use the computers in the labs when they were free. I sometimes had the students move the tables to a circle for lectures so we could discuss. This so irritated a colleague, although we always put them back, that he had the tables tied together with cable binders so that they could not be moved. And many, many more of these small cuts that were so irrigating. 

During studies there were so many stupid jokes told in lectures, that I at one point got up during the lecture (I was sitting in front) and left. I fought back with the Frauenreferat in the AStA. 

My doctoral advisor had to be convinced to give me a paying job and not just take me on as an external student. He felt that since I was married, my husband could pay for food and rent.

Most horrible is the hierarchy at German universities and that the experience of women women somehow doesn't count. In Germany workshops at conferences are held and five men discuss on stage the ""problems of women"" in science, how can that be? I am working with six young women in my team who are constantly confronted with the issue of when is the right time for motherhood? To be honest there is actually no right time for motherhood when persuing a career in science. And the data speaks for itself, men and women are following a similar path until the end of their doctorate and then men proceed onto becoming professors and women don't know how to combine motherhood and a career in science. Of all professorships in Germany only 29 percent are held by women that speaks for itself. I am coordinating a research cluster with a total of 50 projects (yes no tipo you can imagine my workload) and not even a quarter of the PIs are women. In contrast to that women at the Master or doctoral candidate level outnumber men. The director of the instute I am working at likes to devide Post-Doc positions. It means that he hires two Post-Docs at 50 percent but expects that both will work 80 to 100 percent and that's not possible with children. All of the young women in my team have decided to leave science after the project ends next year because of the frustrations and not being able to find a permanent position. As long as the dependence in science stays that way nothing will change for the better.","No","No","Yes","No","","No answer","No","No","No","","","","N/A","N/A","N/A","","","","N/A","N/A","N/A","","","Yes","Yes","Yes","Yes","No","To be exact, after my return to Germany.

I don't really care I am old enough to handle it and I have enough experience but my younger colleagues don't. I also see the issues of men though.

It occurred often that when I entered a room, a male professor would comment on my shoes or would reduce me to appearence, while a male colleague would be addressed with job-related requests or remarks. When asked one professor (with a lot of power) for certain work-related information I would be given a completely different response than another colleague who works for this person (e.g. how many publications do I need for a cumulative habilitation - my colleague was told 4, I was told 10 by the same professor).

The professor is well established, almost retired, but all he cares about is his success and his work and reputation. He said that it is about to start supporting men again, it's been long that universities treat women preferentially and men suffer (This literaly left me speechless). In addition, women decide to have children and by making that decision they automatically decide against academia. The worst thing is that I heard women argue the same way in Berufungsverfahren (mostly older women, wight, from West Germany, with no kids). It makes me really sad to see many skilled women leave academia, although I belive that they made the right decision for themselves.

But there are other ""Mütter"" who have more publications than she does. I think this is wrong, the number of publications is used whenever one is looking for arguments agains a candidate. I have seen it the other way around, when a candidate had far too mininal output but a financially prestigeous grant, when this issue was not an issue any longer.

I have been in three Berufungsverfahren where the only men out of 8 invited got the job. I have seen far too many women leave because they are expected to perform as men, and if they do not, they are just Mütter who decided against a career. They are less likely to fight the arrogance and endure the system and then they leave.","Not sure what exactly  this questionnaire solves. The issues are old and the solution would be to have more Planbarkeit and more secure jobs, which universities won't provide. Not everyone can stay at the university, that is just finde. But we are just wasting talent and motivation of young scientists who have to learn at the age of 35 or 40 that even after 15-20 years of education they do not know whether they can stay in their area of expertise. This is not the same in other parts of the world, this is also not the same for other professions, like doctor or lawyer etc., they know after they finish their study what they can be and where they can find a secure job.

I think it was due to the fact that there was a 'Klinikum' just for students inside universities, so one do not have to wait for months to get an appointment or do not have to be excluded because he/she is not German. I do understand that the number of doctors in Germany is low, but this does not mean there should be a differentiation based on the nationality. For me, my health is my priority in life, the first thing I will look for when applying for a job in the future is a place where I will have access to health services.

I would advise that it is a great time for founding a family if you would like to, in some groups many PhDs get children. Talk to your future colleagues before starting a PhD about how it would be in the group. It is good to understand early what your professor wants you to do before finishing the PhD. Start as early as you can writing articles and writing your PhD thesis. Look for buddies who are writing a monography at the same time as you do to stay motivated. In general, it is good to just do things instead of asking to much and getting a ""no"". If you are too afraid to do things without permission then at least ask your professor privately. I should have asked for way more meetings, support and feedback during my PhD.

Coming from a girl's school, it took me some time to realize, that clothing did not matter at all in my physics studies. Nor in negative nor in positive ways: self-tailored nice garment was not even noticed. After short disappointment I learnt to appreciate that freedom. Switching to engineering changed the situation entirely: suddenly formal clothes were required at least during exams. The first fees as a young scientists I spent on buying white blouses. The first years at congresses and business meetings, the male attendees seemed to dress quite uniformly. As one of the few women at these events I searched for role models ""what to wear"". Most of the few female material scientists did not wear typical business attire, but practical and very individual stiles. That enouraged me to dress in my own colors, in my own preferred stile: My difficulties were self-made. Being one of the few women made me free of conventions.","Yes","Yes","Yes","Yes/Kind of","see above: Decision not to follow conventions","","N/A","N/A","N/A","","","Some equipment in labs is not designed for short people","Yes","Yes","Yes","Yes/Kind of","Ask for help, buy a footstool, assemble a diverse group of people","","N/A","N/A","N/A","","","Yes","No","Yes","No","No","Not being perfectly fit the whole month, trying to avoid longer travelling at ca. 2-3 days a month.

Some researchers will always be given priority over others and given a large enough and mixed sample, this will very likely always have to be answered with ""yes"". On the other hand, what I suspect is meant (but did not ask) is: ""Have you ever faced men are given priority over female researchers at least partially because of their gender?""
But even with that question I am not sure what value results of that question would have. If it is to state the known (?) fact that given priority because of gender happens a lot, then the other side would still be missing from the picture: I would guess that men would answer the corresponding question for women given priority over men almost all with 'yes', too.

However, subtle forms of discrimination still exist e.g. when women feel unable to be as assertive as a male colleague, when organisational responsibilities seem to constantly fall to the woman on the team or when the woman finds herself doing a lot of emotional labour for the team. I find this also adds a lot of stress to the workplace, and is much harder to address because male colleagues are unaware of this, and it is mostly unintentional.","","764","39.96","","","","","","","","","36.51","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","43.5","","","","","15.04","","59.61","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","8.5","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","17.75","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","222.12","","","","","321.01","",""

They uttered these things the first time at the beginning of my PhD aged 23, with them continuing to say so until I defended aged 27 (spoiler alter I did not change my perspective on wanting to become a professor or not wanting to have kids, which should be none of their business anyway). 

Tips that helped me:
Look for male allies. Male researchers advocating for me or just seeing what was going on made a huge difference for me. It's so great when someone else in the room speaks up for you and tells others off (for example, in one case, highlighting that the proposed idea would mean dividing something along the gender line had, I think way more power coming from a senior male scientist than from me). Also, men educating other men seem to be way more fruitful.

Join forces with other women. Hearing others face similar issues made me realize that paternalism and misogyny were at work, not me being wrong.

Educate men. I hate doing this myself, but I would really love if men would just be educated on all the issues women face (including periods) so that they are enabled to reflect on their behaviour or the behaviour of others around them.

Some men have issues talking to women. That is not your problem but theirs. (This is something I am trying to remind myself of constantly)

Leave places where misogyny is present if you can. Being in an environment where I feel much more valued and seen, and I don't have to put up with older men telling me to have kids or dress more feminine really made a difference in my mental health, general well-being and productivity.","Such an important topic, thanks for asking about input and good luck with your work!","2462.7","50.7","","","","","","","","","13.77","","","","","","","36.02","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","8.22","","187.03","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","23.35","","","","","","","","","","","","232.77","","","","","136.65","","","","","","","","","","60.35","","","","","","","149.71","","","","","","","","","","101.27","","","","","103.93","","","","","1358.93","",""
