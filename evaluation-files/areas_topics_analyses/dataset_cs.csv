At all levels of my career there were obstacles for me as a women in science. When I was studying there was still the prejudice about a women studying in computer science, that they might not be capable, that a computer scientist cannot be pretty and clever, ... In my studies it was clearly mentioned by male students that they would never accept a women as a boss (1989). This might have changed but is was the mindset of that time. In all levels of my career I was the only women. When I had success it was then sometimes mentioned that it was because I was a women. Womens' topics and talking about equality was for decades something that women - such as me - were fighting for - it took until around 2020 when more men were stepping in and understanding equality as a responsibility for all genders. I have lost 20% of my intellectual potential and time because I was a women, because I had to show more to get the same positions, because I had to spend time in committee meetings when others made their careers, because I was not in the right boys networks, ... That is a loss not only for me but also a loss for a society as this did not happen to me but to many women. ",Prejudice ,"Never give up, connect in women networks, reveal the inequality in all places and situations I see it, mentor young women, give women a voice, make institutions change and implement gender equality plans. ... keep moving forward.  ",Strengthen_self-esteem/help_by_others,"For too many years I felt it was alway me mentioning to respect and be aware of inequality. For a decade I mentioned it in so many meeting, that it is not only Mitarbeiter but also Mitarbeiterin, that it is not man month but person months and so on.  Women were responsible for gender quality. Women who were acting to make change got a negative image as ""Emanze"" (feminist). The universities took and my institute took a long time to finally implement better rules for gender quality. Only in 2021 we see some gender equality plan  now on the university level, on the level of European Projects and so on. But is was a very long and low process. ",No_reason_mentioned ,"Sticking to it, meeting and exchanging with other women, building networks of women. Promoting young women and giving them the support I never had. ",Help_by_others,"As I was often the only one, the rules on the table were that of men. But at the same time when I behave - as aggressively - as them i was the ""bitch"", I was difficult, I  was having ""hair on teeth"".

Only after time I found out about the other factors of networking and so on. 
As a doctoral student I did not have the problem so much as I was quite successful.

So, I did not continue her contract which was limited anyway.",solution,,,,,"I got a very slow computer with loud keyboard and very small disk space. I was sitting in the same room with my boss. As he said he can not work while I type, he forbade me to type while he is in the office. So, then I started work earlier in the morning to type before he arrives. During his presence, I did not type but read instead. As I started to work early, I thought at first I can go home early. But then he complained that I am lazy and go home so early. So, I came early and stayed as long as before. Instead, I made a longer break around noon, writing private emails. Then, he started telling everyone that during the day, I do not productive work at all. Either I read or I write private emails. He never sees me working. (Because I did the writing in the morning, before he came!) 
The other problem with the disk space: I worked on course material for several weeks. When they were done,  I sent them to my boss by email. Then, I had the file twice: as file and in the emails. To save space, I deleted the email. Then, the disk space still was not sufficient, so I moved the course material to a shared folder in the network. On a day when I was not in the office, my boss deleted this file because he said he did not know what it was and assumed it was useless. As I had sent hom the course by email, I asked him to look for the email and restore the course material, but he did not do it. I asked several times, then I had to understand that my course was lost. ",mobbing/not_suitable_equipment/male_communication,"I lost the job. Not because of the infrastructure, but because of my notorious laziness. I was taken away most of my tasks when people heard that I studied English and French, notthing technical. I did not hear it before I left. In fact, I studied Physics and Engineering (two diplomas). So, that was probably the root cause of the problems. I had also further problems like that I was taken for a secretary, so everyone expected my to have access to my bosses calendar. As I had not, they thought I had instruction to give them no information. Etc etc. There were a lot of complaints about my work because they expected me to be a secretary what I was not. ",no_solution/change_workplace,nan (see “cultural_religion_solution”),male_communication,,,"Usually, it was assumed that I have not studied and have no work experience. I was regularly told to that ""for being sure"" they assume I have no relevant work experience. So, I was considered a job beginner at every job. When a new male colleague came, he was welcomed as ""one man more in the team"" and given real work from the beginning. I was told they have no time for explaining me their work I shall sit and read something and not keep others from working. So, the treatment was different from the beginning., I had different tasks and when I complained, they again explained me the difference between men and women. Men are colleagues, women are constant trainees.",Prejudice/Undermining,,,,,,,"As long as I was young and asking only questions, it was OK for them.

For instance, I was told they were too good, they must stem from someone else with more competence than I can have.
