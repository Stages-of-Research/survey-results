Coming from a girl's school, it took me some time to realizem, that clothing did not matter at all in my physics studies. Nor in negative nor in positive ways: self-tailored nice garment was not even noticed. After short disappointment I learnt to appreciate that freedom. Switching to engineering changed the situation entirely: suddenly formal clothes were required at least during exams. The first fees as a young scientists I spent on buying white blouses. The first years at congresses and business meetings, the male attendees seemed to dress quite uniformly. As one of the few women at these events I searched for role models ""what to wear"". Most of the few female material scientists did not wear typical business attire, but practical and very individual stiles. That enouraged me to dress in my own colors, in my own preferred stile: My difficulties were self-made. Being one of the few women made me free of conventions.",conventions,see above: Decision not to follow conventions,strengthen_self_esteem,,,,,Some equipment in labs is not designed for short people,not_suitable_equipment,"Ask for help, buy a footstool, assemble a diverse group of people",workaround,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"see above: Equimpent with too high windows, handles,...",Not_suitable_equipment ,"see above: Footstool, help, diverse group",Help_by_others,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Womens achievements are not visible if only initials are qouted,Not_only_female,"Giving whole names, wherever it is possible.
