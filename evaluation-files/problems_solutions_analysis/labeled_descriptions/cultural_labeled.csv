109;nan;;nan;;"Clothing conventions make you feel comfortable in a group. Coming from a girl's school, it took me some time to realizem, that clothing did not matter at all in my physics studies. Nor in negative nor in positive ways: self-tailored nice garment was not even noticed. After short disappointment I learnt to appreciate that freedom. Switching to engineering changed the situation entirely: suddenly formal clothes were required at least during exams. The first fees as a young scientists I spent on buying white blouses. The first years at congresses and business meetings, the male attendees seemed to dress quite uniformly. As one of the few women at these events I searched for role models ""what to wear"". Most of the few female material scientists did not wear typical business attire, but practical and very individual stiles. That enouraged me to dress in my own colors, in my own preferred stile: My difficulties were self-made. Being one of the few women made me free of conventions.";conventions;see above: Decision not to follow conventions;strengthen_self_esteem;nan;;nan;;Some equipment in labs is not designed for short people;not_suitable_equipment;Ask for help, buy a footstool, assemble a diverse group of people;workaround;nan;;nan;

As he said he can not work while I type, he forbade me to type while he is in the office. So, then I started work earlier in the morning to type before he arrives. During his presence, I did not type but read instead. As I started to work early, I thought at first I can go home early. But then he complained that I am lazy and go home so early. So, I came early and stayed as long as before. Instead, I made a longer break around noon, writing private emails. Then, he started telling everyone that during the day, I do not productive work at all. Either I read or I write private emails. He never sees me working. (Because I did the writing in the morning, before he came!) 
The other problem with the disk space: I worked on course material for several weeks. When they were done,  I sent them to my boss by email. Then, I had the file twice: as file and in the emails. To save space, I deleted the email. Then, the disk space still was not sufficient, so I moved the course material to a shared folder in the network. On a day when I was not in the office, my boss deleted this file because he said he did not know what it was and assumed it was useless. As I had sent hom the course by email, I asked him to look for the email and restore the course material, but he did not do it. I asked several times, then I had to understand that my course was lost. ";mobbing/not_suitable_equipment/male_communication;I lost the job. Not because of the infrastructure, but because of my notorious laziness. I was taken away most of my tasks when people heard that I studied English and French, notthing technical. I did not hear it before I left. In fact, I studied Physics and Engineering (two diplomas). So, that was probably the root cause of the problems. I had also further problems like that I was taken for a secretary, so everyone expected my to have access to my bosses calendar. As I had not, they thought I had instruction to give them no information. Etc etc. There were a lot of complaints about my work because they expected me to be a secretary what I was not. ;no_solution/change_workplace;nan (see “cultural_religion_solution”);male_communication;nan;
