Most horrible is the hierarchy at German universities and that the experience of women women somehow doesn't count. In Germany workshops at conferences are held and five men discuss on stage the ""problems of women"" in science, how can that be? I am working with six young women in my team who are constantly confronted with the issue of when is the right time for motherhood? To be honest there is actually no right time for motherhood when persuing a career in science. And the data speaks for itself, men and women are following a similar path until the end of their doctorate and then men proceed onto becoming professors and women don't know how to combine motherhood and a career in science. Of all professorships in Germany only 29 percent are held by women that speaks for itself. I am coordinating a research cluster with a total of 50 projects (yes no tipo you can imagine my workload) and not even a quarter of the PIs are women. In contrast to that women at the Master or doctoral candidate level outnumber men. The director of the instute I am working at likes to devide Post-Doc positions. It means that he hires two Post-Docs at 50 percent but expects that both will work 80 to 100 percent and that's not possible with children. All of the young women in my team have decided to leave science after the project ends next year because of the frustrations and not being able to find a permanent position.
