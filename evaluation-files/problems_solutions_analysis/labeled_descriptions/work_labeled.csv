10;Well, the idea that there is equality is not true, specifically when it comes to a career.  At all levels of my career there were obstacles for me as a women in science. When I was studying there was still the prejudice about a women studying in computer science, that they might not be capable, that a computer scientist cannot be pretty and clever, ... In my studies it was clearly mentioned by male students that they would never accept a women as a boss (1989). This might have changed but is was the mindset of that time. In all levels of my career I was the only women. When I had success it was then sometimes mentioned that it was because I was a women. Womens' topics and talking about equality was for decades something that women - such as me - were fighting for - it took until around 2020 when more men were stepping in and understanding equality as a responsibility for all genders. I have lost 20% of my intellectual potential and time because I was a women, because I had to show more to get the same positions, because I had to spend time in committee meetings when others made their careers, because I was not in the right boys networks, ... That is a loss not only for me but also a loss for a society as this did not happen to me but to many women. ;Prejudice ;Never give up, connect in women networks, reveal the inequality in all places and situations I see it, mentor young women, give women a voice, make institutions change and implement gender equality plans. ... keep moving forward.  ;Strengthen_self-esteem/help_by_others;"For too many years I felt it was alway me mentioning to respect and be aware of inequality. For a decade I mentioned it in so many meeting, that it is not only Mitarbeiter but also Mitarbeiterin, that it is not man month but person months and so on.  Women were responsible for gender quality. Women who were acting to make change got a negative image as ""Emanze"" (feminist). The universities took and my institute took a long time to finally implement better rules for gender quality. Only in 2021 we see some gender equality plan  now on the university level, on the level of European Projects and so on. But is was a very long and low process.

I don't really care I am old enough to handle it and I have enough experience but my younger colleagues don't. I also see the issues of men though.

Lately (Im at the very end of my phd) I sometimes here the comment (when talking about becoming professors) that I have high chances to become one because Im a woman. Not because im skilled or eager. Just because women are prefered in generell. (Which is depatable in my opinion having under 10% female professors in my field in Germany).
